## Credit Scoring Project

Overview:

This is a credit scoring project that features main steps learned from the Machine Learning Zoomcamp lessons until 6th week. 
The project includes basic data preparation, exploratory analysis, and machine learning.

Why I chose this project?

This is mainly because I will soon deal with a lot of this type of problems in my current job. I am currently Data Analyst/Scientist that was tasked to handle ECl Modelling. This will be a huge help to actually enhance my skills to be better at my job. Appologies as this project is kind-off similar to the example project on 6th week.

Model used: XGBoost

How to use?

Execute the run_service.bat to run the model service. Please note that you need an active docker running.

The notebook used to train the model is available, if you want to simulate the training, please note that you need the packages installed in your environment.

After executing the run_service.bat, you can simulate the post request through the simulate-post-request.ipynb, there is an example borrower profile defined there.
